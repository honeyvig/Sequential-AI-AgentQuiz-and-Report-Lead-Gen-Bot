# Sequential-AI-AgentQuiz-and-Report-Lead-Gen-Bot
create a multi agent sequential AI lead generation quiz and report building system below is the brief within N8N

I will be using job form for the front end chat box the first prompt will be asking the questions for my Industry sectors relating to the blindspots and the opportunities I can highlight in the report. Secondly the second AI agent will be interrogating the output from the answers and creating an analysis and the report Below is the not only the N8N workflow, including the tools (Zoho CRM Professional Jotform, Gpt prompts x2, n8n)

I will be including two goals within this workflow one of which is dynamic. These goals are going to trigger the email sequences for clicks opens and those goals. We will need an N8N for dynamic tracking rules that are not covered by the CRM. This is also included in the report below.

--------
To create a multi-agent AI lead generation quiz and report-building system using N8N, Jobform, Zoho CRM, GPT prompts, and automated email sequences, we need to develop an efficient workflow for collecting data, analyzing it, and delivering personalized reports based on the provided answers. Additionally, we need to dynamically track goals and triggers, providing seamless interaction between various services.

Below is an outline of the N8N workflow for building this system:
1. Workflow Overview

    User Interaction via Jobform (Front-End)
        Jobform will collect responses from users related to the industry sectors, blind spots, and opportunities.
        The first AI agent will trigger based on the responses and provide some initial analysis and questions based on the responses.

    Second AI Agent (Analysis and Report Creation)
        After receiving the responses, a second AI agent will analyze the answers and generate a report by triggering GPT prompts.

    Dynamic Goal Tracking (For Clicks and Opens)
        N8N will use dynamic tracking for engagement like email clicks and opens. This will be used to trigger specific follow-up actions, such as personalized email sequences based on user behavior.

    CRM Integration (Zoho CRM)
        The leads collected will be sent to Zoho CRM for further tracking and follow-up.
        This CRM will also keep track of the engagement based on the goals achieved.

2. N8N Workflow Components

Below is an outline of how to set up an N8N workflow to achieve this system. It includes integrating Jobform, GPT-3 for report generation, Zoho CRM for lead management, and dynamic goal tracking for email engagement.
Step 1: Collect Data from Jobform

Use the Jobform trigger to receive form submissions. This will collect the answers for your lead generation quiz.

Jobform Trigger (Form Submission)

    Input: User answers from the Jobform (quiz questions).
    Output: Responses for each question in the form (e.g., blind spots, industry sector).

Step 2: Process Responses (First AI Agent)

Use the responses from Jobform as input for the first AI agent, which will ask additional probing questions and evaluate the user's needs.

GPT-3 Prompt for AI Agent 1

    Input: Jobform responses.
    Prompt Example: "Based on the user’s answers, generate a follow-up question related to their blind spots and opportunities."

Step 3: Generate Report with Second AI Agent

After the user submits their quiz responses, use GPT-3 (or another LLM) to analyze the collected data and generate a personalized report based on the first AI agent's output.

GPT-3 Prompt for Report Generation

    Input: Answers from Jobform and AI Agent 1's follow-up analysis.
    Prompt Example: "Create a detailed report based on the user’s blind spots and opportunities in their industry sector. Highlight key insights and recommendations."
    Output: Personalized analysis and report content.

Step 4: Store and Manage Leads in Zoho CRM

The generated leads and analysis need to be sent to Zoho CRM for tracking and follow-up actions.

Zoho CRM Node (Create Lead)

    Input: User's name, email, industry sector, blind spots, opportunities, and the generated report.
    Output: New lead entry in Zoho CRM with all the details.

Example: Use the Zoho CRM API integration in N8N to add leads and categorize based on the provided industry data and generated report.
Step 5: Dynamic Goal Tracking (Email Open/Click Tracking)

Set up dynamic tracking using N8N for tracking email opens, clicks, and other engagement metrics. This will allow follow-up actions based on user behavior.

Email Trigger (Track Opens/Clicks)

    Input: User's email activity (clicks, opens).
    Output: Dynamic goal tracking that adjusts email sequences based on user interactions.

Use the following tools for integration:

    SMTP Email Node to send emails and track opens and clicks.
    Webhooks for dynamic tracking of user actions (e.g., opening an email or clicking on a link).

Step 6: Trigger Follow-up Email Sequences

If a user clicks on the link or opens an email, set dynamic rules to trigger further emails or send them a second round of personalized questions or reports.

Follow-Up Email Sequence Trigger

    Input: Goal achievement (open, click).
    Output: Trigger follow-up email sequences based on user activity.

Step 7: Visualize Reports

Once the report is generated and saved, you can visualize the data for the user. N8N can push this report to a dashboard or send it via email.

Report Generation Visualization

    Input: The report content generated by GPT-3.
    Output: A formatted report to be sent via email or added to the dashboard.

3. N8N Workflow Example in Steps

Here is a basic structure of the workflow in N8N:

    Start Node: Trigger the workflow when the user submits the form on Jobform (Jobform Trigger).
    First AI Agent (GPT-3): Analyze answers and generate follow-up questions.
    Second AI Agent (GPT-3): Generate detailed report based on user responses and analysis.
    Zoho CRM Integration: Create a new lead in Zoho CRM.
    Dynamic Email Tracking: Track user interaction (opens, clicks) via email nodes.
    Email Sequences Trigger: Set up dynamic email triggers based on interaction (click/open).
    Report Visualization: Generate and send the personalized report via email or CRM.

4. Example GPT-3 Prompts
First AI Agent Prompt:

"Based on the user’s response to the quiz about their industry sector and blind spots, ask follow-up questions about their opportunities. Focus on their growth potential in their sector."

Second AI Agent Prompt (Report Generation):

"Create a detailed and personalized report based on the following data:
- Industry Sector: {Industry}
- Blind Spot: {Blind Spot}
- Opportunity: {Opportunity}
Provide key insights, actionable recommendations, and how the user can improve their business based on these insights."

5. Dynamic Goal Tracking in N8N

    Email Tracking: Use N8N to track if a user opens an email or clicks on a link. This triggers a workflow to adjust email sequences or goals.
    Dynamic Goal System: Based on clicks/opens, update the user's status in the CRM or trigger further actions.

6. Key Tools/Services

    Jobform: For user interaction and data collection (quiz form).
    GPT-3: For generating follow-up questions and personalized reports.
    Zoho CRM: For storing and managing leads.
    N8N: To orchestrate the entire workflow, including data collection, AI processing, and dynamic goal tracking.
    Email Integration: For tracking user activity and dynamically adjusting email sequences.

Conclusion

This workflow allows you to efficiently create an automated lead generation system, analyze responses with AI agents, and build personalized reports. Additionally, by dynamically tracking user engagement, the system ensures that leads are nurtured effectively based on their interactions.
